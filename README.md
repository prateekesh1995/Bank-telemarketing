# Bank-telemarketing
This is by analyzing customer features, the bank will be able to predict customer saving behaviors and identify which customers is likely to make term deposits
Importing and Gathering the Data
Importing the Following Libraries-:
1. Pandas-For Data Manipulation
2. Numpy - For Matrix Operation
3. Matplotlib- Its Numerical Mathematics extension Numpy
4. Seaborn- Visualization for Python
Data Cleaning-:
1. By Cleaning the unnecessary Variables or by Dropping the Missing Values or Impute the Highest Values in the place of missing values.

2. Z- Score-
It is useful because it allows us to calculate the probability of a score occurring within our normal distribution. Which basically describes the position of a raw score in terms of its distance from the mean. It's normally converts the random data to normalised data that too to Standard normalization data.
Using the Z-score we can normalize the Data and drop the outliers.
3. Convert the Duration from seconds to Minutes
4. Convert the Alphabets to Numeric for Python to understand and implement for modelling

5. Plotting the Correlation plot with each other to drop one of the variables as they contribute the same effect on the dependent variable.

5. EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
It is basically done for to refers to the critical process of performing initial investigation on the data, performing Visualisation and investigation on data to discover patterns or to test for Hypothesis testing and check assumption by the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

Modelling-:
Logistic Regression--- It is used for the binary dependent variable. Its like True or False. Its range lies between 0 and 1. The dependent variable is the Categorical Variable.

MAchine Learning Techniques(Applied because to fit the test data nicely to the train data)
Applied Decision Tree

Applied Random Forest

Applied SVM (For Better Accuracy)
